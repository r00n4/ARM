The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTM32 Board
using a ST STM32F103RBT6 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - PB8 : LED_RD   is on when USB Device is performing Read access
  - PB9 : LED_WR   is on when USB Device is performing Write access
  - PB10: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - PB11: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  MCBSTM32: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J1 to PD2 for debugging
